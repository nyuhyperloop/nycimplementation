Impacts of pollution or gentrification must also be at the forefront of the selection process.  \n  \n**Centrality:** We want to consider stop locations which are in areas of high population density, especially populations which are likely to be underserved (higher amount of those commuting to NYC than exisiting transportation can handle).  \n  \n**Accessibility:** Since a hyperloop has an incredibly high throughput, potential stop locations must have the resources and or infrastructure to support large flows of passengers (ie. major roads, public transportation).  \n  \n**Ease of implementation:** Regulations and costs provide a major barrier to implementation. Locations and routes which can use existing brownfield infrastructure are ideal, as this minimises cost and impact on local communities. Larger cities tend to have more potential ridership but provide more diffculty in terms of legal regulations."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Grand Central Terminal (Manhattan)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Positives:\n* Popular station (2nd busiest MTA station)\n* Centrally located in Manhattan\n* Big station allows for more foot traffic\n* Near many large offices, especially big banks & tech companies\n* Connections to many local lines and busses, as well as the Metro-North train\n\nConsiderations:\n* High implmentation costs, expensive real estate\n* Extremely busy station\n* Regulatory hurdles would likely be very high (legal and construction barriers)\n* LIRR is being built into the station in the next few years"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Smith Haven Mall, Lake Grove (Long Island) "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Positives:\n* Centrally located on Long Island - access to major modes of transport within LI while alternative modes of transportation to the city take longer, and/or are more complicated\n* Near highly populated cities, including Brookhaven, Islip and Smithtown\n* Located in a relatively wealthy/socioeconomically developed area, people would be more willing to pay higher fare for Hyperloop\n* Plenty of real estate for development\n\nWhy Smith Haven Mall Specifically?  \nIt is the main attraction for Lake Grove.
